# tutorialPyTorch
Hi everyone,
for our next TechClub, we made this tutorial to teach you how to train your own neural network!

For this tutorial we will use PyTorch. To save some time, we ask you to already install PyTorch using the following link:
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ 

If you have no background about neural networks at all, you can watch this video in which the basics of neural networks are explained:
