# tutorialPyTorch
Hi everyone,
for our next TechClub, we made this tutorial to teach you how to train your own neural network!
You can find it under filename 'tutorial_notebook.ipynb'.

For this tutorial we will use PyTorch. To save some time, we ask you to already install PyTorch using the following link:
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ 

Additionally, the tutorial is written in a Jupyter Notebook and should therefore be viewed in an environment compatible with Jupyter Notebooks.
If you are using Anaconda, you can open this notebook by opening the Anaconda Navigator. If you scroll down a bit you will find ‘Jupyter Notebook’ which you can open by clicking on the ‘launch’ button. Then, you can select the folder in which the notebook is stored and open the file.
Alternatively, if you are using VSCode and do not have it yet installed, please follow the installation instructions here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks

Lastly, if you have no background about neural networks at all, you can watch this video in which the basics of neural networks are explained:

Please contact us if you are running into issues or if anything is unclear!
